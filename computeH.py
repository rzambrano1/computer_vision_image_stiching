def computeH(t1: npt.NDArray, t2: npt.NDArray)-> npt.NDArray:
    """
    Takes a set of corresponding image points t1, t2 (both t1 and t2 should be 2xN matrices) and computes the associated 3 x 3 homography matrix H. The client should
    provide a list of P â‰¥ 4 pairs of corresponding points from the two views, where each point is specified with its own 2d image coordinates. 

    Input:
        t1, a numpy array with dimension 2xP with coordinates for corresponding points from image view A, P should be greater than 3. Top row are x coordinates, bottom row are y coordinates
        t2, a numpy array with dimension 2xP with coordinates for corresponding points from image view B, P should be greater than 3. Top row are x coordinates, bottom row are y coordinates
    
    Output:
        homography_matrix, the 3x3 homography matrix H associated with the two list of corresponding points
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    t1 : np.ndarray [shape=(2,P)]
    t2 : np.ndarray [shape=(2,P)]
    
    P > 3

    Returns
    -------
    homography_matrix: np.ndarray [shape=(3,3)]

    Throws
    ------
    Raises:AssertionError, if the dimensions of either t1 or t2 are not equal
    Raises:AssertionError, if the number of rows of either t1 or t2 are greater than 2
    Raises:AssertionError, if the number of columns of either t1 or t2 are not greater than 4
